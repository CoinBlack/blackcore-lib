# Using bitcore-lib with Blackcoin

This repository shows how to use [bitcore-lib](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/tree/master/packages/bitcore-lib) for Blackcoin development in javascript.

This is a fork of bitcore-lib-peercoin: https://github.com/peercoin/bitcore-lib-peercoin

[patch-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package) is being used to patch the upstream bitcore-lib and allow it to handle Blackcoin specifics.

In order to use `patch-package` you must drop the `patches` directory into you work directory and edit the `package.json` to include `"postinstall": "patch-package"` in the `"scripts"` section. See the attached `package.json` file for the example.

Using patch-package simplifies the process of adapting upstream bitcore-lib to work with Blackcoin as all developers must worry about is the local bitcore-lib.*.patch.

Upon running "npm install" you will notice message like in the log:
```
"Applying patches...
bitcore-lib@8.25.25 âœ”
```

Which means that bitcore-lib has been patched upon installation.
